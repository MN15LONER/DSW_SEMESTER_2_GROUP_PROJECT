# Google Sign-In Integration Guide for Mzansi React

This guide will help you complete the Google Sign-In setup for your Expo app.

## ✅ What Has Been Done

The following files have been created/modified to add Google Sign-In functionality:

1. **New Files Created:**
   - `src/services/googleAuth.js` - Google authentication service
   - `src/components/GoogleSignInButton.js` - Reusable Google sign-in button component
   - `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_SETUP.md` - This setup guide

2. **Modified Files:**
   - `src/context/AuthContext.js` - Added `loginWithGoogle` method
   - `src/screens/auth/LoginScreen.js` - Integrated Google sign-in button
   - `app.config.js` - Added authentication scheme and bundle identifiers
   - `.env` - Added Google Web Client ID placeholder

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- A Firebase project (you already have this: `mzansi-react`)
- Access to Firebase Console
- Expo CLI installed

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Required Dependencies

Run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install expo-auth-session expo-web-browser expo-crypto
```

Or if you use yarn:

```bash
yarn add expo-auth-session expo-web-browser expo-crypto
```

### Step 2: Enable Google Sign-In in Firebase

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: **mzansi-react**
3. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Sign-in method**
4. Click on **Google** in the providers list
5. Click **Enable**
6. Set a project support email (required)
7. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Get Your Google Web Client ID

After enabling Google sign-in:

1. In the same Google provider settings, you'll see **Web SDK configuration**
2. Copy the **Web client ID** (it looks like: `123456789-abcdefg.apps.googleusercontent.com`)
3. Open your `.env` file
4. Replace `your_google_web_client_id_here` with your actual Web Client ID:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID=123456789-abcdefg.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

### Step 4: Configure OAuth Redirect URI

**IMPORTANT**: You must add the Expo AuthSession proxy redirect URI to Firebase.

1. In Firebase Console, still in the Google provider settings
2. Scroll down to **Authorized redirect URIs**
3. Click **Add URI** and add the following:
   ```
   https://auth.expo.io/@mn15loner/mzansi-react
   ```
4. Also ensure `auth.expo.io` is in the **Authorized domains** section
5. Click **Save**

**Note**: The redirect URI `https://auth.expo.io/@mn15loner/mzansi-react` is automatically generated by Expo's AuthSession proxy and works for both:
- Development (Expo Go)
- Production builds

### Step 5: Restart Your Expo Development Server

After making these changes, restart your Expo server:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
npm start
```

Or:

```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

## 🧪 Testing in Expo Go

The implementation is designed to work with **Expo Go**:

1. Open your app in Expo Go
2. Navigate to the Login screen
3. Tap the **"Sign in with Google"** button
4. A browser window will open for Google authentication
5. Sign in with your Google account
6. You'll be redirected back to the app
7. The app will create a user profile in Firebase (if it's a new user)

## 🔍 How It Works

### Authentication Flow

1. **User taps Google Sign-In button** → `LoginScreen.js`
2. **Initiates OAuth flow** → `googleAuth.js` using `expo-auth-session`
3. **User authenticates in browser** → Google OAuth
4. **Receives ID token** → Returned to app via redirect
5. **Exchanges token with Firebase** → `signInWithCredential`
6. **Creates/updates user profile** → `AuthContext.js`
7. **User is logged in** → Navigation to main app

### New User Handling

When a user signs in with Google for the first time:
- A new user document is created in Firestore (`users` collection)
- User data includes: email, display name, photo URL, auth provider
- The `authProvider` field is set to `'google'`

### Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:
- Invalid credentials
- Cancelled sign-in
- Network errors
- Configuration errors
- Account conflicts

└── app.config.js                        # Updated with auth scheme
```

## 🎨 UI Features

The Google Sign-In button:
- Matches the existing login screen style
- Shows Google logo (using Ionicons)
- Has white background with border (Google brand guidelines)
- Shows loading state during authentication
- Disables when authentication is in progress

## 🔒 Security Notes

1. **Web Client ID Only**: The implementation uses only the Web Client ID for Expo Go compatibility
2. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All sensitive data is in `.env` file
3. **Firebase Authentication**: All authentication is handled by Firebase
4. **Secure Token Exchange**: ID tokens are exchanged securely with Firebase

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Google Web Client ID is not configured" Error

**Solution**: Make sure you've added the Web Client ID to your `.env` file and restarted the Expo server.

### Google Sign-In Opens but Doesn't Redirect Back

**Solution**: 
- Ensure `auth.expo.io` is in Firebase authorized domains
- Check that `scheme: 'mzansireact'` is in `app.config.js`
- Restart Expo development server

### "Account exists with different credential" Error

**Solution**: This means the email is already registered with email/password. The user should sign in with their original method or link accounts (advanced feature).

### Button is Disabled

**Solution**: 
- Check that dependencies are installed
- Ensure the Google auth request is initialized (check console for errors)
- Verify Web Client ID is configured

## 📱 Building for Production

When you're ready to build standalone apps:

### For Android:
1. You'll need to add Android Client ID from Firebase
2. Add SHA-1 fingerprint to Firebase project
3. Update `googleAuth.js` to include `androidClientId`

### For iOS:
1. You'll need to add iOS Client ID from Firebase
2. Add iOS bundle ID to Firebase project
3. Update `googleAuth.js` to include `iosClientId`
4. Add URL scheme to `app.config.js`

**Note**: The current implementation works perfectly with Expo Go using only the Web Client ID.
