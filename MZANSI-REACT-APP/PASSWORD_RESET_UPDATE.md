# Password Reset Service Update - Firebase Domain Fix

## 🔧 Changes Made

### Issue Fixed
**"Domain not allowlisted" Error**

The password reset was failing because the custom deep link scheme (`mzansireact://`) was not authorized in Firebase. This has been fixed by using the Firebase-authorized domain.

### Solution Implemented

Updated `src/services/passwordResetService.js` to use Firebase's authorized domain:

**Before:**
```javascript
await sendPasswordResetEmail(auth, normalizedEmail, {
  url: 'mzansireact://reset-password',  // ❌ Not authorized
  handleCodeInApp: false,
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
await sendPasswordResetEmail(auth, normalizedEmail, {
  url: 'https://mzansi-react.firebaseapp.com/reset-password',  // ✅ Authorized
  handleCodeInApp: true,  // ✅ Secure in-app handling
});
```

## 🔒 Security Features Preserved

All existing security features remain intact:

### ✅ Rate Limiting
- **Max 3 attempts per email per 15 minutes**
- Stored in AsyncStorage
- Automatic cleanup of old attempts
- Clear error messages with time remaining

```javascript
const RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW = 15 * 60 * 1000; // 15 minutes
const MAX_RESET_ATTEMPTS = 3;
```

### ✅ Email Enumeration Prevention
- **Generic success messages for all cases**
- Same response whether email exists or not
- Prevents attackers from discovering valid emails

```javascript
return {
  success: true,
  message: 'If an account exists with this email, you will receive password reset instructions shortly.',
};
```

### ✅ Security Logging
- **All attempts logged to Firestore**
- Collection: `security_logs`
- Includes: email, status, timestamp, reason
- Non-blocking (doesn't fail operation if logging fails)

```javascript
await logPasswordResetRequest(normalizedEmail, 'success');
```

### ✅ Strong Password Validation
All password rules remain enforced:

```javascript
const PASSWORD_RULES = {
  minLength: 8,                // Minimum 8 characters
  requireUppercase: true,      // At least 1 uppercase letter
  requireLowercase: true,      // At least 1 lowercase letter
  requireNumber: true,         // At least 1 number
  requireSpecialChar: true,    // At least 1 special character
};
```

## 🔗 How the Reset Link Works Now

### Email Link Flow

1. **User requests password reset**
   - Enters email on ForgotPasswordScreen
   - System validates and checks rate limiting

2. **Firebase sends email**
   - Contains link to: `https://mzansi-react.firebaseapp.com/reset-password?oobCode=xxx`
   - Link includes secure token (`oobCode`)
   - Token is time-limited (1 hour)

3. **User clicks link**
   - Opens in device browser
   - Redirects to Firebase-hosted page
   - Firebase verifies token automatically

4. **User enters new password**
   - Firebase-hosted page handles password input
   - Password is validated against rules
   - Token is invalidated after successful reset

5. **User returns to app**
   - Can now log in with new password

## 🌐 Firebase Authorized Domains

The reset link now uses `mzansi-react.firebaseapp.com`, which is automatically authorized by Firebase.

### Verify Authorization

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select project: **mzansi-react**
3. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Settings**
4. Scroll to **Authorized domains**
5. Verify `mzansi-react.firebaseapp.com` is listed

### Default Authorized Domains

Firebase automatically authorizes:
- `localhost` (for local development)
- `*.firebaseapp.com` (your Firebase hosting domain)
- Any custom domains you've added

## 📱 In-App Handling

With `handleCodeInApp: true`, the reset process is more secure:

### Benefits

1. **Secure Token Handling**
   - Token never exposed in URL bar
   - Handled securely by Firebase SDK

2. **Better User Experience**
   - Seamless flow from email to password reset
   - No need to manually copy/paste codes

3. **Automatic Verification**
   - Firebase verifies token validity
   - Checks expiration automatically
   - Ensures one-time use

## 🧪 Testing the Updated Flow

### Test Steps

1. **Start the app**
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

2. **Request password reset**
   - Navigate to Login screen
   - Tap "Forgot Password?"
   - Enter your email
   - Tap "Send Reset Link"

3. **Check email**
   - Look for email from Firebase
   - Check spam folder if not in inbox

4. **Click reset link**
   - Should open in browser
   - Should show Firebase-hosted reset page
   - Should NOT show "Domain not allowlisted" error

5. **Enter new password**
   - Must meet all validation rules
   - Should see success message

6. **Return to app**
   - Log in with new password
   - Should work successfully

### Expected Results

✅ No "Domain not allowlisted" error
✅ Email received successfully
✅ Reset link opens without errors
✅ Password can be reset
✅ Can log in with new password

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Still Getting "Domain not allowlisted" Error

**Possible Causes:**
1. Domain not in Firebase authorized list
2. Firebase configuration not synced
3. Browser cache issues

**Solutions:**
1. Verify domain in Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains
2. Wait a few minutes for Firebase to sync
3. Clear browser cache and try again
4. Try in incognito/private browsing mode

### Email Link Opens but Shows Error

**Possible Causes:**
1. Token expired (> 1 hour old)
2. Token already used
3. Network connectivity issues

**Solutions:**
1. Request a new reset link
2. Check internet connection
3. Try different browser

### Password Validation Fails

**Possible Causes:**
1. Password doesn't meet requirements
2. Password too short
3. Missing required character types

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure password has:
   - At least 8 characters
   - 1 uppercase letter (A-Z)
   - 1 lowercase letter (a-z)
   - 1 number (0-9)
   - 1 special character (!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>)

## 📊 Monitoring

### Security Logs

All password reset attempts are still logged to Firestore:

```javascript
// Firestore collection: security_logs
{
  type: 'password_reset_request',
  email: 'user@example.com',
  status: 'success' | 'failed' | 'rate_limited',
  reason: 'Additional context',
  timestamp: '2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z',
  userAgent: 'Expo Mobile App'
}
```

### What to Monitor

- **Success rate**: Should be high (>90%)
- **Rate limited requests**: Indicates potential abuse
- **Failed requests**: May indicate configuration issues
- **Unusual patterns**: Multiple requests for same email

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Why This Approach is Secure

1. **Firebase-Managed Tokens**
   - Cryptographically secure
   - Time-limited (1 hour)
   - One-time use only

2. **HTTPS Only**
   - All communication encrypted
   - No man-in-the-middle attacks

3. **Domain Validation**
   - Only authorized domains accepted
   - Prevents phishing attacks

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Prevents brute force
   - Limits abuse potential

5. **Email Enumeration Prevention**
   - Generic messages
   - Same response time
   - No information leakage

6. **Security Logging**
   - Audit trail
   - Suspicious activity detection
   - Compliance support

## 📚 Additional Configuration

### Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain for reset links:

1. Set up Firebase Hosting with custom domain
2. Add custom domain to Firebase authorized domains
3. Update the `url` in `passwordResetService.js`:

```javascript
await sendPasswordResetEmail(auth, normalizedEmail, {
  url: 'https://your-custom-domain.com/reset-password',
  handleCodeInApp: true,
});
```

### Email Template Customization

Customize the reset email in Firebase Console:

1. Go to **Authentication** → **Templates**
2. Select **Password reset**
3. Edit:
   - Subject line
   - Body text
   - Sender name
   - Reply-to address

## ✅ Summary

### What Changed
- ✅ Updated reset link URL to use Firebase-authorized domain
- ✅ Changed `handleCodeInApp` to `true` for secure in-app handling
- ✅ Fixed "Domain not allowlisted" error

### What Stayed the Same
- ✅ Rate limiting (3 attempts / 15 min)
- ✅ Email enumeration prevention
- ✅ Security logging to Firestore
- ✅ Strong password validation
- ✅ Token security (time-limited, one-time use)
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ User interface

### Result
